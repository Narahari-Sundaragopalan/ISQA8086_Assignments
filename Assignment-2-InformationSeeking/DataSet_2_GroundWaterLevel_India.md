## Ground water level measurements of districts in India

> This data set lists the ground water level measurements of various districts in India released by Central Groundwater Board, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India. This dataset gives us the ground water level value in meters between 2005 - 2011. In a country like India, where the monsoons are unpredictable, and agriculture depends a lot on monsoon, understanding the ground water level progress over a period of five years gives an opportunity to study and analyze what needs to be done to improve the levels and figure out solution for water storage. The dataset will give an idea on which districts are in dearth of water resources.
