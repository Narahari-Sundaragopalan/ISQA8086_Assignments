## Problems with current Data Organization

  1. All the three sample files are not in the same format with respect to column headers. So it is difficult to compare the data from year 2010 to 2011.

  2. Some of the column names, storing values, do not have proper units specified. So it is not possible to know what scale was used to measure them. For example, Temperature column is not specified if it is in Celsius or Fahrenheit. "Density" column does not have proper units

  3. Since this is a data measured at different times during a day, there is no time column specified. For example, some columns have same "Date" value for the same species. So the time during which the sample was collected is not specified.

  4. Some of the column names are not informative or easy to interpret. For example, the column name "z" does not convey anything about the kind of values stored in that columns.

  5. Density value was calculated in year 2010 samples, but not calculated or noted in the year 2011

  6. Graphs do not have their axes specified properly. For example, the graph says "Cuni#/L" but does not mention how it is plotted and against what it is plotted.

  7. There is inconsistency in graph representation of data set. For one type of species there is a graphical representation, which it is not present for the other species.

  8. There are missing values in the spreadsheets for some of the columns. Some of the rows are empty and highlighted in yellow and some of them are simply empty.

  9. Some rows are highlighted in red or other colors, but not specified as to why is it done.

  ## Suggestions for Data Organization

There are many ways in which the current data organization can be improved and made standard. The above mentioned issues should be corrected.
* The spreadsheets should have a "Legend" or "Keys" tab to specify or elaborate on the column names and their meanings
* All the files should be in the same format with same column names
* Missing values can be filled by taking extra sample values or simply skipping them
* Highlighted rows can be specified as to why they are highlighted
* Column names can be made clear and informative
* Proper Units should be mentioned in columns
* If average values are calculated, they should be mentioned clearly to what they are depicting
* Density is a column calculated in year 2010, which is not recorded in 2011. So a standard should be maintained.
